# GIS-for-Insurance-tracking-real-time-wildfires-in-the-US

In this experiment, we will try to use geopandas to combine geo-coded location data with open and almost real time burning wildfire data from the NIFC - https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/.

We will connect to real time basis with an API of the NIFC Current Wildfire perimeters in the U.S.

We will use a spatial join to figure out which of the geo-coded locations in the portfolio are actually burning and then use Folium to plot this is in a map
